Data structures are broadly divided into two categories: **Linear** and **Non-Linear**.

> * **Linear Data Structures** include: **Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue**
>     
> * **Non-Linear Data Structures** include: **Tree, Graph**
>

## Analysis of Algorithm:

**We typically analyze algorithms using three types of complexity analysis:**

1. **Best Case Analysis** – Represented by **Ω (Omega)**: Describes the performance of an algorithm under the most optimal conditions.
    
2. **Average Case Analysis** – Represented by **Θ (Theta)**: Describes the expected performance for a typical input.
    
3. **Worst Case Analysis** – Represented by **O (Big-O)**: Describes the performance under the least favorable conditions.
    
    > ⚠️ **Note:** If someone asks, *"What is the time complexity of this program?"* without specifying whether they mean best, average, or worst case — you should assume they are referring to the **worst-case time complexity (Big-O)**.
    
    ## Understanding Rate of Growth in Programming (Beginner-Friendly)
    
    #### Common Types of Mathematical Equations:
    
    These are called **polynomial equations** – they show how a function grows as the input increases.
    
    1. **Linear Equation**:  
        Example: `y = mx + c` or `ax + by + c = 0`  
        ➤ Growth is steady — increases in a straight line.
        
    2. **Quadratic Equation**:  
        Example: `y = ax² + bx + c`  
        ➤ Growth gets faster, shaped like a U or ∩ on a graph.
        
    3. **Cubic Equation**:  
        Example: `y = ax³ + bx² + cx + d`  
        ➤ Grows even faster than quadratic.
        
    4. **Bi-Quadratic Equation**:  
        Example: `y = ax⁴ + bx³ + cx² + dx + e`  
        ➤ Grows very rapidly with larger inputs.
        
    
    #### Other Common Growth Types:
    
    * **Logarithmic Equation**:  
        Example: `y = a·log(x) + b`  
        ➤ Grows slowly as input increases.
        
    * **Exponential Equation**:  
        Example: `y = e^x + 3x`  
        ➤ Grows extremely fast — even faster than polynomial equations.

    ### Why Should We Learn About the Rate of Growth?
    
    Let’s break it down:
    
    * Imagine we have a **software program**.
        
    * It takes some **input**, processes it, and gives an **output**.
        
    * The time it takes depends on the input size.
        
    
    Now, suppose we write a function `f(x)` to represent what the program does — this is called a **mathematical model** of the program.
    
    If we **plot this function on a graph**, we can see how the output (e.g., time taken) grows with input size.
    
    That shape (or **growth rate**) tells us how efficient the program is.

    ### In Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA):
    
    * We **design a program** (or algorithm).
        
    * Then, we **write a mathematical equation** to represent its behavior.
        
    * By analyzing this equation, we can figure out the **time complexity**.
        
        * Is it fast (like `O(log n)`)?
            
        * Or slow (like `O(n²)` or worse )?
            
    
    This is why learning **rate of growth** is so important — it helps us understand and compare the performance of different programs.

    ### Sample Graph (Input vs. Time Taken)
    
    Here’s a basic idea of how such a graph would look:

           |              * (Exponential)
           |          *
           |      *       (Quadratic)
           |    *
           |  *           (Linear)
           |*  
           +------------------------------→ Input Size
