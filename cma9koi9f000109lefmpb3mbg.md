## From Linear to Quadratic Time Complexity

#### Quadratic Equation Example:

Letâ€™s take this equation:

> **f(n) = 2nÂ² + 3n - 5**

Now plug in a large value, like **n = 3000**:

> **f(3000) = 2(3000)Â² + 3(3000) - 5**  
> **f(3000) = 18,000,000 + 9000 - 5 = 18,008,995**

As you can see, the **2nÂ²** part gives us **18 million**, while the **3n** and **\-5** are tiny in comparison.

---

### What Does This Mean?

In quadratic equations, as `n` grows larger, the **nÂ² term dominates** the growth. So we **focus on nÂ²** and ignore the rest when analyzing time complexity.

> So, **f(n) = 2nÂ² + 3n - 5** simplifies to **O(nÂ²)**

---

### Real-Life Example (Quadratic):

Imagine youâ€™re planning seating for a party.  
You want to pair every guest with every other guest for a handshake.

* If you have 10 guests, the number of handshakes is close to **nÂ²**.
    
* If you double the guests to 20, the number of handshakes doesnâ€™t just double it **quadruples**!
    

This is what **quadratic growth** feels like it increases rapidly with `n`.

---

### Now Letâ€™s Look at a **Cubic Equation**

> **f(n) = anÂ³ + bnÂ² + cn + d**

Example:

> **f(n) = 2nÂ³ + 5nÂ² + 4n + 10**

---

### Whatâ€™s the Most Dominant Term?

You're right if you said:

> **nÂ³ is the most dominant** term when `n` is large.

So we ignore the smaller parts and focus only on the term with the **highest power**.

> So, **f(n) â‰ˆ O(nÂ³)**

---

### Real-Life Example (Cubic):

Imagine you have a 3D box made of cubes.  
If each side is `n` cubes long, then the total number of small cubes inside is **n Ã— n Ã— n = nÂ³**.

* If `n = 10` â†’ you have 1,000 cubes
    
* If `n = 100` â†’ you have 1,000,000 cubes!
    

The growth explodes â€” thatâ€™s cubic complexity.
